Hello, I'm Marcus!
 
I'm a front-end engineer from Sweden ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª and I love working with React and Node. I currently work on open source projects for nodejs and postcss and love to deep dive into accessibility topics. I help organize [WordPress meetups](https://www.meetup.com/WordPress-Stockholm/) in Stockholm and sometimes I write tech related articles around the web. Thanks for reading!
